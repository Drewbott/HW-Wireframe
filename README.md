# HW-Wireframe
I used a variety of different CSS methods to achieve the result. 
Keeping in mind the Box model, I was able to get the right look for the wireframe.
Trickiest were getting all of the pixel sizes and widths to match up as you are constantly 'adding' pixels when you add padding, etc to the boxes within the box
